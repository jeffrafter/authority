== Authority

  You are making an application that uses authlogic. You don't want to start
  from scratch.

== Getting started

First, don't share secrets.

  rake secret   

Copy this into config/initializers/session_store.rb

Next, update the email and host in config/environment.rb. You can move these
to their own initializer or make them environment specific if you want. Then
setup your database:

  cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
  rake db:migrate
  
Run the tests:

  rake 
  rake features
